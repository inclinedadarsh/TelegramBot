# TelegramBot
Hey whoever is reading this. 
First of all I don't know Python at all! Neither do I know any other language!

I wanted to create this simple Truth and Dare Telegram Bot.
Did it using PyCharm, Python Language. 
Just took different codes from different websites and put them togethere. 
I don't know if there are bugs in it, if there are then please fix them and tell me as well.
You can use the code anywhere.
I personally don't know how to put codes so i directly upoaded the files.


You have to install a few libraries, for this bot the libraby I'm using is python-telegram-bot , you can type 'pip install python-telegram-bot' in your command prompt or wherever you're going to run this bot.
